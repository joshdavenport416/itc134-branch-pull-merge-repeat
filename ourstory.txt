Once upon a time, deep in the dark Viridian Forest, Ash discovers a Caterpie and tries his best to make his first Pokemon catch. 
"Caterpie, youâ€™re mine!" Ash procaimed, excitedly. "Yes, I got it! Ha! Ha! I did it! I got a Caterpie! I did it all by myself! I caught a first Pokemon! This is the first step on my way to becoming the number one Pokemon master in the whole world."
