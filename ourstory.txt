Once upon a time, deep in the dark Viridian Forest, Ash discovers a Caterpie and tries his best to make his first Pokemon catch. 
"Caterpie, you’re mine!" Ash procaimed, excitedly. "Yes, I got it! Ha! Ha! I did it! I got a Caterpie! I did it all by myself! I caught a first Pokemon! This is the first step on my way to becoming the number one Pokemon master in the whole world."
Ash: Oh, Misty you are so unbelievable, Caterpie means no harm why it likes you all never know. Caterpie, what’s the matter? Hey, hold on, Caterpie!

Ash: All right, Misty! You owe Caterpie an apology! Pokémon have feelings too, you know!  Come on, Caterpie. Don’t you worry someday we’ll show her.

Hey Ash! whats up? its been a while. where have you been?

Ash: Oh, you know - nowhere in particular. I'm just out here trying to be the greatest Pokemon Master. Anyway, let's get this Caterpie to the Pokemon Center, Misty!


Hey, is there a HelloKitty Pokemon quest?  I would like to be the first trainer in the world with the first HelloKitty Pokemon creature. 
Misty: You should try to learn something about Pokemon first. With Pokemon you’ve got to your strategy. Pigeotto is a bird. Caterpie is a worm. Birds eat Mr. Pokemon Master.

Ash: Well, if you just try hard enough, things will work out, won’t they?

Misty: NO! Ash, I’m afraid things won’t just work out if you try hard enough. The Pokemon Trainers judgement is more important than anything else and unfortunately for you the trainer has to have a brain.

Jessie: Ahahahaha

James: We meet again.

Ash: I know that voice.

Jessie: To protect the world from devastation.

James: To unite all peoples within our nation.
