Once upon a time, deep in the dark Viridian Forest, Ash discovers a Caterpie and tries his best to make his first Pokemon catch. 
"Caterpie, you’re mine!" Ash procaimed, excitedly. "Yes, I got it! Ha! Ha! I did it! I got a Caterpie! I did it all by myself! I caught a first Pokemon! This is the first step on my way to becoming the number one Pokemon master in the whole world."
Ash: Oh, Misty you are so unbelievable, Caterpie means no harm why it likes you all never know. Caterpie, what’s the matter? Hey, hold on, Caterpie!

Ash: All right, Misty! You owe Caterpie an apology! Pokémon have feelings too, you know!  Come on, Caterpie. Don’t you worry someday we’ll show her.

Hey Ash! whats up? its been a while. where have you been?

Ash: Oh, you know - nowhere in particular. I'm just out here trying to be the greatest Pokemon Master. Anyway, let's get this Caterpie to the Pokemon Center, Misty!


Hey, is there a HelloKitty Pokemon quest?  I would like to be the first trainer in the world with the first HelloKitty Pokemon creature.
